**... or you can populate the docs automatically, by using the following procedure:**

1. make sure you have the following packages:
	```
	sudo apt-get install python3-sphinx
	pip install sphinxcontrib-napoleon
	```
	(used to parse google style docstrings)
	
2. if not already present, make sure in conf.py you have:
	extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc',
    		      'sphinx.ext.githubpages',
                      'sphinx.ext.napoleon']
                     
3. build your API documentation. This will create all the .rst files from your project in docs
	sphinx-apidoc -f -o docs/source projectdir
	
4. if some import errors shows up, add in your conf.py in docs:
	autodoc_mock_imports = ["missing_package"]
